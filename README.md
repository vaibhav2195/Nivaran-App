Nivaran is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to bridge the gap between citizens and local authorities by providing a platform for reporting, tracking, and resolving civic issues.

## Overview

Nivaran empowers citizens to report various local problems such as potholes, garbage dumping, street light outages, and more, directly from their mobile devices. These reports, enriched with details, images, and geo-location, are then accessible to concerned officials for timely acknowledgement and resolution. The app aims to foster transparency and efficiency in addressing public grievances.

## Features

1. **Secure User Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication with biometric support ensures robust security for user accounts. Users can sign up via email, social media, or phone verification, with automatic session management and secure password recovery options.

2. **AI-Powered Issue Categorization**: Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the app automatically categorizes reported issues into predefined categories like infrastructure, sanitation, or public safety. This feature includes smart suggestions for issue resolution based on historical data and similar cases.

3. **Real-Time Collaboration Platform**: Citizens and officials can collaborate seamlessly on issue resolution through integrated live chat, document sharing, and progress tracking. This fosters transparent communication and accelerates problem-solving processes.

4. **Predictive Maintenance Alerts**: Using AI-driven analytics, the app predicts potential civic issues before they escalate. Based on patterns in reported data, users receive proactive alerts about areas prone to problems, enabling preventive measures.

5. **Offline Reporting Capability**: Full offline functionality allows users to capture and store issue reports without internet connectivity. Reports are automatically synchronized when connectivity is restored, ensuring no data loss in remote or low-signal areas.

6. **Integrated Map Visualization**: Interactive maps with customizable heatmaps display issue density, resolution status, and geographic trends. Users can zoom, filter, and overlay data layers for comprehensive spatial analysis of civic challenges.

7. **Community Impact Tracking**: Detailed dashboards provide analytics on community engagement, issue resolution rates, and overall impact. Citizens can view their contribution to local improvements, while officials track performance metrics and resource allocation.

8. **Multi-Language Support**: Comprehensive localization supports multiple languages, making the app accessible to diverse user groups. Voice commands, text input, and notifications are available in regional languages, promoting inclusivity and wider adoption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Flutter SDK (version 3.x recommended)
* Dart SDK (version 3.x recommended)
* An IDE like Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter plugins.
* Firebase account and a new Firebase project.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/nivaran.git](https://github.com/your-username/nivaran.git) # Replace with your repo URL
    cd nivaran
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Firebase Configuration:**
    * Set up a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Add an Android app and an iOS app to your Firebase project.
    * **Android:**
        * Download the `google-services.json` file from your Firebase project settings.
        * Place it in the `android/app/` directory.
        * Ensure your Android package name in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` matches the one in Firebase.
    * **iOS:**
        * Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from your Firebase project settings.
        * Open the `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and add this file to the `Runner` target.
        * Ensure your iOS bundle ID in Xcode matches the one in Firebase.
    * **Enable Firebase Services:**
        * **Authentication:** Enable Email/Password, Google, and Facebook sign-in methods in the Firebase console. For Facebook login, additional setup on the Facebook Developer portal is required.
        * **Cloud Firestore:** Create a Firestore database. Set up appropriate security rules.
        * **Firebase Storage:** Set up Firebase Storage. Configure security rules (e.g., allow authenticated users to write to specific paths).
        * **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):** No specific enablement needed in console for basic setup, but ensure API is enabled if using legacy protocols.

4.  **Google Maps API Key:**
    * Obtain a Google Maps API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/maps-android-sdk-backend.googleapis.com). Ensure "Maps SDK for Android" and "Maps SDK for iOS" are enabled.
    * **Android:** Add the API key to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
        ```xml
        <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
                   android:value="YOUR_ANDROID_MAPS_API_KEY"/>
        ```
    * **iOS:** Add the API key to `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`:
        ```swift
        import UIKit
        import Flutter
        import GoogleMaps // Add this import

        @UIApplicationMain
        @objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
          override func application(
            _ application: UIApplication,
            didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
          ) -> Bool {
            GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR_IOS_MAPS_API_KEY") // Add this line
            GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
            return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
          }
        }
        ```

5.  **Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended):**
    * If using `flutter_dotenv`, create a `.env` file in the root of your project:
        ```
        # Example .env file
        # API_KEY_EXAMPLE=your_api_key_here
        ```
    * Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.
    * Load these in your `main.dart` or service files.

6.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    Or use your IDE's run button.
