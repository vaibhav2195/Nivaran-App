Nivaran is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to bridge the gap between citizens and local authorities by providing a platform for reporting, tracking, and resolving civic issues.

## Overview

Nivaran empowers citizens to report various local problems such as potholes, garbage dumping, street light outages, and more, directly from their mobile devices. These reports, enriched with details, images, and geo-location, are then accessible to concerned officials for timely acknowledgement and resolution. The app aims to foster transparency and efficiency in addressing public grievances.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Flutter SDK (version 3.x recommended)
* Dart SDK (version 3.x recommended)
* An IDE like Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter plugins.
* Firebase account and a new Firebase project.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/nivaran.git](https://github.com/your-username/nivaran.git) # Replace with your repo URL
    cd nivaran
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Firebase Configuration:**
    * Set up a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Add an Android app and an iOS app to your Firebase project.
    * **Android:**
        * Download the `google-services.json` file from your Firebase project settings.
        * Place it in the `android/app/` directory.
        * Ensure your Android package name in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` matches the one in Firebase.
    * **iOS:**
        * Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from your Firebase project settings.
        * Open the `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and add this file to the `Runner` target.
        * Ensure your iOS bundle ID in Xcode matches the one in Firebase.
    * **Enable Firebase Services:**
        * **Authentication:** Enable Email/Password, Google, and Facebook sign-in methods in the Firebase console. For Facebook login, additional setup on the Facebook Developer portal is required.
        * **Cloud Firestore:** Create a Firestore database. Set up appropriate security rules.
        * **Firebase Storage:** Set up Firebase Storage. Configure security rules (e.g., allow authenticated users to write to specific paths).
        * **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):** No specific enablement needed in console for basic setup, but ensure API is enabled if using legacy protocols.

4.  **Google Maps API Key:**
    * Obtain a Google Maps API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/maps-android-sdk-backend.googleapis.com). Ensure "Maps SDK for Android" and "Maps SDK for iOS" are enabled.
    * **Android:** Add the API key to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
        ```xml
        <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
                   android:value="YOUR_ANDROID_MAPS_API_KEY"/>
        ```
    * **iOS:** Add the API key to `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`:
        ```swift
        import UIKit
        import Flutter
        import GoogleMaps // Add this import

        @UIApplicationMain
        @objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
          override func application(
            _ application: UIApplication,
            didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
          ) -> Bool {
            GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR_IOS_MAPS_API_KEY") // Add this line
            GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
            return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
          }
        }
        ```

5.  **Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended):**
    * If using `flutter_dotenv`, create a `.env` file in the root of your project:
        ```
        # Example .env file
        # API_KEY_EXAMPLE=your_api_key_here
        ```
    * Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.
    * Load these in your `main.dart` or service files.

6.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    Or use your IDE's run button.
