Nivaran is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to bridge the gap between citizens and local authorities by providing a platform for reporting, tracking, and resolving civic issues.

## Overview

Nivaran empowers citizens to report various local problems such as potholes, garbage dumping, street light outages, and more, directly from their mobile devices. These reports, enriched with details, images, and geo-location, are then accessible to concerned officials for timely acknowledgement and resolution. The app aims to foster transparency and efficiency in addressing public grievances.

## Features

1.  **Secure User Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication with biometric support ensures robust security for user accounts. Users can sign up via email, social media, or phone verification, with automatic session management and secure password recovery options.

2.  **AI-Powered Issue Categorization**: Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the app automatically categorizes reported issues into predefined categories like infrastructure, sanitation, or public safety. This feature includes smart suggestions for issue resolution based on historical data and similar cases.

3.  **Real-Time Collaboration Platform**: Citizens and officials can collaborate seamlessly on issue resolution through integrated live chat, document sharing, and progress tracking. This fosters transparent communication and accelerates problem-solving processes.

4.  **Predictive Maintenance Alerts**: Using AI-driven analytics, the app predicts potential civic issues before they escalate. Based on patterns in reported data, users receive proactive alerts about areas prone to problems, enabling preventive measures.

5.  **Offline Reporting Capability**: Full offline functionality allows users to capture and store issue reports without internet connectivity. Reports are automatically synchronized when connectivity is restored, ensuring no data loss in remote or low-signal areas.

6.  **Integrated Map Visualization**: Interactive maps with customizable heatmaps display issue density, resolution status, and geographic trends. Users can zoom, filter, and overlay data layers for comprehensive spatial analysis of civic challenges.

7.  **Community Impact Tracking**: Detailed dashboards provide analytics on community engagement, issue resolution rates, and overall impact. Citizens can view their contribution to local improvements, while officials track performance metrics and resource allocation.

8.  **Multi-Language Support**: Comprehensive localization supports multiple languages, making the app accessible to diverse user groups. Voice commands, text input, and notifications are available in regional languages, promoting inclusivity and wider adoption.
